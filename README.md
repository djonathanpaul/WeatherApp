# WeatherApp

This is a simple weather application that has been created using Modern JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS.  


# Sources Used for fetching Weather Info Details

I have made use of AccuWeather API (link - https://developer.accuweather.com/) that provide access to their weather API endpoints, including Locations, Current Conditions, and Daily and Hourly Forecasts.
